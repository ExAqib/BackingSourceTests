Before testing, make sure the shared file path is accessible by all machined. For Remote VM, run following command in PowerShell to share the folder:
    New-PSDrive -Name $driveLetter -PSProvider FileSystem -Root $networkPath -Credential $credential
For example:
    New-PSDrive -Name Z -PSProvider FileSystem -Root \\PDC\fileshare -Credential Domain\User
